## Credit Scoring
Credit scoring refers to the use of machine learning models to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals or organizations. By analyzing historical financial data and other relevant features, predictive models can estimate the likelihood of loan repayment, default risk, and assign credit scores. These models help financial institutions make informed lending decisions and manage risk.

## Disease Prediction
Disease prediction involves leveraging data science and machine learning techniques to forecast the probability of disease occurrence in patients. By analyzing medical records, patient demographics, genetic information, and other health-related data, predictive models can identify at-risk individuals, assist in early diagnosis, and enable proactive healthcare interventions.
